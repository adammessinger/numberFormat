#numberFormat

This is a small library of number formatting utilities I've been using in my work.
I split them off and refactored them as an exercise in test-driven development,
and posted them here for more practice working with Git and GitHub.

More of a readme is coming at some point in the future. Meanwhile, what these
functions do and how they work is fairly self-evident (I hope) from looking through
the source and the tests.
